Welcome to The Re-Learning Release, a newsletter documenting my return to the foundations of knowledge. This space is for revisiting the logic beneath the tools we rely on today (thank you, AI) and reminding ourselves why they work in the first place.
The idea began as a reflection on my transition out of academia. I asked myself: Could I still engage with the math I once spent years learning? While I had forgotten the mechanics, what unsettled me more was realizing I couldn’t always follow the reasoning. That moment was a signal to go back to the basics.

In research and practice, evaluation and validation are enduring metrics; they vouch for our contributions. But I believe our future depends just as much on adaptability: the ability to apply resources with confidence because we understand what they’re built on. This newsletter is my attempt to relearn, reflect, and release that journey through the iterative process of the 6R's.

6R Process:
* Reread – Read again for nuance.
Purpose: Gain deeper understanding beyond first impressions.
* Relearn – Reacquire knowledge once forgotten.
Purpose: Tap into existing mental pathways for faster learning.
* Review – Summarize and check understanding.
Purpose: Consolidate information, spot gaps.
* Reteach – Teach again, often in a new way.
Purpose: Clear up misconceptions or deepen clarity.
* Reflect – Pause and connect to experience.
Purpose: Make knowledge stick by personalizing it.
* Release – Share or apply the knowledge.
Purpose: Lock in learning by using or teaching it.
